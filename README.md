# Auction-Smart-Contract
This is an auction smart contract developed using the Solidity programming language for the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is automated and the entire code has been explained in the `auction.sol` file.

## How to use
1. Install a suitable Ethereum wallet and make sure it is connected to the Ethereum network.
2. Copy the code from the auction.sol file and paste it in a Solidity compiler, such as Remix.
3. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network.
4. Interact with the contract using your Ethereum wallet.

Note: Ensure to have sufficient Ether in your wallet to pay for the transaction fees while deploying and interacting with the contract.
